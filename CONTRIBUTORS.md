## Assessment and Implementation

**Primary Contributor:** [Your Name] - See [AUTHOR.md](AUTHOR.md) for full details

This repository provides a **formal assessment and working implementation** of Marius Buliga's work on interaction combinators and chemlambda.

### Assessment Role

This work represents an **independent evaluation** of Buliga's contributions, including:
- Critical analysis of theoretical foundations
- Evaluation of practical implementations  
- Identification of strengths, weaknesses, and gaps
- Comparative analysis with related work
- Formal assessment of value and significance

### Contributions

- **Formal Assessment:** Critical evaluation of Buliga's theoretical and practical contributions
- **Implementation:** Working Python and JavaScript implementations of chemlambda systems
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of all systems, reactions, and examples
- **Visualization:** D3.js visualizations matching Buliga's original style
- **Analysis:** Identification of strengths, weaknesses, gaps, and future directions
