# Ouroboros Quine

The Ouroboros is a famous quine graph in chemlambda, inspired by the lambda calculus predecessor term. It demonstrates self-replication through parallel graph rewriting.

## What is Ouroboros?

The **Ouroboros** is a self-replicating graph that:
- Can create copies of itself through parallel rewrites
- Named after the mythical snake eating its own tail
- Demonstrates circular self-reference
- Exhibits artificial life properties

## Definition

A quine graph that:
- Has non-conflicting matches of rewrite patterns
- After parallel application, produces an isomorphic copy
- Can replicate through random rewriting algorithms
- Shows stable replication behavior

## Structure

### Inspired by Predecessor Term

The Ouroboros is inspired by the lambda calculus predecessor term:
- **Predecessor function**: Computes predecessor of a natural number
- **Self-reference**: Contains circular references
- **Graph structure**: Encoded as a chemlambda graph

### Graph Properties

- **Circular structure**: Contains cycles
- **Self-similar**: Parts resemble the whole
- **Replicable**: Can produce copies of itself

## Replication Mechanism

### Parallel Rewrites

The Ouroboros replicates through:
1. **Pattern matching**: Finding non-conflicting rewrite patterns
2. **Parallel application**: Applying all matches simultaneously
3. **Isomorphism**: Result is isomorphic to original
4. **Replication**: Produces copy of itself

### Non-Conflicting Matches

For replication to work:
- Must have multiple rewrite matches
- Matches must not conflict (not share nodes)
- Can be applied in parallel
- Result preserves structure

### Random Rewriting

With random rewriting algorithms:
- Random selection of applicable rewrites
- Can lead to replication or death
- Probabilistic behavior
- Similar to biological processes

## Artificial Life Properties

### Metabolism

- **Processes structures**: Transforms itself through reactions
- **Maintains identity**: Stays isomorphic to itself
- **Life-like**: Exhibits life-like behavior

### Replication

- **Self-reproduction**: Creates copies of itself
- **Through rewrites**: Uses graph rewriting
- **Demonstrates life**: Shows life-like properties

### Death

- **Can fail**: May not always replicate
- **Destruction**: Can be destroyed by reactions
- **Mortality**: Shows mortality

## Experimental Studies

### Replication Success

Studies show:
- **Probability**: Probability of successful replication
- **Factors**: What affects replication success
- **Stability**: How stable replication is

### Hazard Functions

- **Lifespan**: How long Ouroboros survives
- **Aging**: Does it show senescence?
- **Death rate**: Probability of death over time

### Population Dynamics

- **Multiple copies**: Behavior with multiple Ouroboros
- **Competition**: Do they compete?
- **Growth**: Population growth patterns

## Significance

### Artificial Life

- **Life-like behavior**: Demonstrates life-like properties
- **Self-replication**: Shows self-reproduction
- **Emergence**: Life emerges from computation

### Graph Rewriting

- **Quine graphs**: First major quine example
- **Self-reference**: Demonstrates self-reference in graphs
- **Replication**: Shows replication in graph rewriting

### Molecular Computing

- **Potential**: Could be implemented in chemistry
- **Self-replicating computers**: Possibility of self-replicating computers
- **Biological connection**: Connection to biological replication

## Comparison with Other Quines

### 9-Quine

- **Smaller**: Has only 9 nodes
- **Simpler**: Simpler structure
- **Still replicates**: Also exhibits replication

### Ackermann Quines

- **More complex**: Combine computation with replication
- **Different purpose**: Computation + replication
- **Complex behavior**: More complex than pure quines

## Visual Representation

### Graph Structure

The Ouroboros has a circular structure:
- **Cycles**: Contains cycles
- **Self-similar**: Parts resemble whole
- **Replicable**: Structure enables replication

### Replication Process

```
Ouroboros → [parallel rewrites] → Ouroboros + Ouroboros
```

The graph replicates itself through parallel rewrites.

## Research Directions
